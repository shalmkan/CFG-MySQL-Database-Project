Whilst completing Code First Girl's Introduction to Data Science and SQL course, I completed a project using MySQL to create and query a database. The database I constructed is based on data I feel would be relevant to COVID-19 test centres (all data was mock data and query results did not demonstrate real life trends). 

In this repository, please find:
- a .txt file containing a backup of my database
- a .pdf file containing an EER diagram of my database
- and a .sql file demonstrating the creation of my database as well as multiple queries.
