Whilst completing Code First Girl's Introduction to Data Science and SQL course I completed a project using MySqL to create and query a database.The database I constructed is  based on data i feel would be relavent to COVID-19 test centres (all data was mock data and query results did not demonstrate real life trends). 
In this repositry please find:
- a .txt file containing a backup of my database
- a .pdf file containing an EER diagram of my database
- and a .sql file demonstrating the creation of my database as well as multiple queries.
